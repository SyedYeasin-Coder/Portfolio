                    Hi, I’m Syed Yeasin, a 5th-semester Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate with a strong
                    interest in web development, game development, and graphic design. My journey began in 2016 with
                    graphic design, where I worked on numerous projects using tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and
                    Adobe Animate, sharpening my creative eye.
                    Alongside design, I ventured into programming—starting with Scratch, then learning C and C++, before
                    exploring object-oriented programming in Java and building a café management system. As I
                    progressed, I discovered my passion for web development. I started with HTML and CSS, gradually
                    moving into JavaScript, and eventually into backend development with Django, where I built a
                    StudyRoom website that strengthened my understanding of full-stack development.
                    I’ve also experimented with Unity and Lua to create small games, but web development became the
                    space where my creativity and technical knowledge align best. With a balance of design expertise and
                    programming skills, I enjoy building digital solutions that are not only functional but also
                    engaging and user-friendly.
